/**
 * This Firestore Security Ruleset establishes a strict, user-centric security model
 * for the MediShelf application. Its core philosophy is data isolation, ensuring that
 * each user can only ever access their own information.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The rules enforce a strict user-ownership model. All data is scoped to the
 * authenticated user, and there is no concept of public or shared data. This
 * provides maximum privacy and security by default.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All user-generated content, specifically medicine inventories, is nested within a
 * dedicated user document. The hierarchical structure is `/users/{userId}/medicines/{medicineId}`.
 * This design makes ownership explicit in the document path itself.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Data Isolation: All access checks are based on matching the authenticated
 *   user's UID (`request.auth.uid`) with the `{userId}` in the document path.
 * - No Public Listing: Listing the top-level `/users` collection is explicitly
 *   disallowed to prevent enumeration of application users.
 * - Path-Based Security: Rules leverage the document path for authorization, which
 *   is highly performant and avoids costly cross-document `get()` calls. This
 *   ensures that security checks are efficient and scalable.
 * - Prototyping Flexibility: While authorization is strict, data shape validation is
 *   minimal. This allows for rapid development and schema changes on the client-side
 *   without requiring constant updates to the security rules. Only fields critical
 *   for relational integrity (like document IDs) are validated.
